## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I switch between tiers?
Yes! Upgrade or downgrade at any time. Upgrades take effect immediately. Downgrades start at your next billing cycle so you keep premium features until then.

### What happens if I cancel?
You'll keep your subscription benefits until the end of your current billing period. After that, your account reverts to Free tier. All your saved preferences and library history remain intact.

### Can I use my subscription on multiple devices?
Yes! Your subscription is tied to your account, not your device. Sign in on any device (iOS, Android, or web) to access your subscription.

### Do you offer student or educator discounts?
Not yet, but we're exploring this. Email brandonqin@berkeley.edu if you're interested - we'll notify you when available.

### What payment methods do you accept?
All payments are processed through Apple App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android). We accept any payment method your app store supports (credit card, PayPal, Apple Pay, etc.).

### Can I get a refund?
Refund policies are managed by Apple and Google's app stores. Generally:
- Apple: Request refund through reportaproblem.apple.com
- Google: Request refund through Google Play Store (within 48 hours)

We cannot process refunds directly, but we're happy to help resolve any issues - just reach out to brandonqin@berkeley.edu.

### Is there a family plan?
Not currently, but it's on our roadmap. Each subscription is individual for now.

### What happens to my saved podcasts if I downgrade?
Your library history remains accessible regardless of tier. However:
- Free tier: Can access last 30 days of episodes
- Pro tier: Full unlimited library access
- Max tier: Full unlimited library access + offline downloads

### Can I pause my subscription?
Not directly, but you can cancel and resubscribe anytime. Your preferences and library will be waiting for you when you return.

We don't sell your data. We don't show ads. We don't play favorites with publishers. Your subscription supports independent, personalized news consumption.
